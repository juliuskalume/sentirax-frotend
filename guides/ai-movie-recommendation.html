  <h1>AI Movie Recommendation App: How SentiraX Suggests Films Based on Your Mood</h1>
  <p><strong>Your guide to AI-powered movie suggestions, mood-based film discovery, and emotionally aware recommendations.</strong></p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>What Is an AI Movie Recommendation App?</h2>
  <p>
    An <strong>AI movie recommendation app</strong> uses machine learning to analyze your tastes and suggest films you’re likely to enjoy. Most rely on genre tags or what’s trending.
  </p>
  <p>
    SentiraX goes further by using <strong>mood signals</strong> and <strong>emotional tone matching</strong> to choose movies that fit how you feel right now.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How AI Movie Recommendations Work (In Simple Terms)</h2>
  <p>AI movie suggestion engines typically look at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your movie history</li>
    <li>your emotional preferences</li>
    <li>themes, tone, and pacing of films</li>
    <li>your watchlist, skips, and feedback</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    SentiraX blends these with real-time mood tracking to create highly personal recommendations.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What Makes SentiraX Different?</h2>
  <p>Almost every streaming app gives recommendations based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>genre similarity</li>
    <li>popularity rankings</li>
    <li>“people also watched” behavior</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SentiraX instead asks:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>How do you feel?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>What emotional energy do you want the movie to have?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Do you want something calming, thrilling, cozy, dark, or funny?</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This flips recommendation logic from <em>“Here’s what’s trending”</em> to  
    <em>“Here’s what matches your emotional state.”</em>
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How SentiraX Uses Mood + AI to Suggest Films</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>You check in with your mood.</strong> Chill, stressed, bored, nostalgic, hyper, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>AI analyzes your emotional preferences.</strong> Different moods → different film tones.</li>
    <li><strong>It evaluates movie “vibes.”</strong> Cozy, chaotic, dramatic, tender, fast-paced—thousands of tone signals.</li>
    <li><strong>You give feedback.</strong> Add to watchlist, skip, or request new suggestions.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The more you use it, the better it understands you.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How to Choose the Best AI Movie Recommendation App</h2>
  <p>Look for an app that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>adapts to mood changes</li>
    <li>analyzes emotional tone, not just genres</li>
    <li>avoids repetitive recommendations</li>
    <li>protects your data and lets you control it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>SentiraX was designed intentionally with these in mind.</p>
