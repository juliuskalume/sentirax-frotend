  <h1>Mood-Based Watching: How SentiraX Matches Movies to Your Feelings</h1>
  <p><strong>The complete guide to discovering movies based on emotion, not just genre.</strong></p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>What Is Mood-Based Watching?</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional recommendation systems rely on genres, popularity, and algorithms that analyze what other people watched.  
    <strong>Mood-based watching</strong> flips that idea entirely by asking a much simpler and more human question:
  </p>
  <p style="font-style: italic;">
    “How do you feel right now — and what kind of movie fits that mood?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Our emotional state influences what we want to watch far more than categories like “Action” or “Comedy.”  
    A comedy hits differently when you’re tired versus when you’re energetic.  
    A thriller feels different when you’re stressed versus when you're bored.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why Mood Matters More Than Genre</h2>
  <p>Here’s the reality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can love dramas and still not want a heavy drama every night.</li>
    <li>You can enjoy horror but not when your anxiety is high.</li>
    <li>You can like action movies but not when you’re emotionally drained.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Mood-based watching works because emotional tone changes *daily*,  
    while personal taste changes *slowly*.  
    SentiraX adapts in real time based on how you feel.
  </p>

  <h2>How SentiraX Understands Mood</h2>
  <p>
    SentiraX blends mood inputs and film analysis to choose movies that feel right for you.  
    Here’s how:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>You check in with your mood.</strong> Chill, stressed, emotional, bored, energetic, nostalgic — anything.</li>
    <li><strong>The AI analyzes tone and energy.</strong> Not just genres but pacing, themes, emotional atmosphere, character intensity, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>It filters out things you won’t want right now.</strong> (Example: removing heavy dramas when you're tired.)</li>
    <li><strong>You get recommendations that match your emotional needs, not trends.</strong></li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Examples of Mood-Based Movie Choices</h2>
  <p>Here are examples of how moods map to film tones:</p>

  <h3>😴 Tired or drained</h3>
  <ul><li>Cozy comedies</li><li>Light romance</li><li>Gentle slice-of-life films</li></ul>

  <h3>🌧 Feeling emotional or reflective</h3>
  <ul><li>Bittersweet dramas</li><li>Warm character-driven stories</li><li>Thoughtful indie films</li></ul>

  <h3>⚡ Energetic or hyped</h3>
  <ul><li>Fast-paced action</li><li>High-energy adventure</li><li>Stylized thrillers</li></ul>

  <h3>😕 Bored or restless</h3>
  <ul><li>Engaging mysteries</li><li>Smart sci-fi</li><li>Interesting documentaries</li></ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How SentiraX Learns Your Emotional Taste</h2>
  <p>SentiraX improves with every interaction:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every mood check-in teaches it how your emotional patterns work.</li>
    <li>Every “Add to watchlist” or skip refines its understanding.</li>
    <li>It notices which tones you favor in each mood.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Eventually, SentiraX can predict what will feel right *before* you even know what you want.

<section>
  <h2>Why Mood-Based Watching Solves Decision Fatigue</h2>
  <p>
    Endless scrolling is a modern problem — not because choices are bad,  
    but because they’re not filtered by emotion.  
    Mood-based filters cut through that instantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    You don’t need to browse 300 titles.  
    You need 3 recommendations that perfectly match your mood.
