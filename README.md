## ✨ What this does

SentiraX lets users:

- Set up a small taste profile  
- Check in with their current mood and vibe  
- Get AI-ranked movie/show suggestions  
- Include 18+ films if they’re of legal age  

The entire UI is served from a **single `index.html` file** (simple, fast, deployable anywhere).
